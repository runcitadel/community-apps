This repository contains additional apps maintained by the Citadel community.
These apps are not maintained by the Core citadel team, but are instead being maintained by members of the community.

## Development workflow

All development happens in the `v3-dev` branch. Apps in the v3-dev branch are also automatically updated for new upstream releases.

Once the apps are tested, they can be merged to the `v3-beta` branch by a repository contributor.

They will be released to the `v3-stable` branch if they are confirmed to work correctly.

A push to the `v3-stable` can only happen by a trusted contributor (listed below).

## Trusted contributors

These people have push access to the `v3-stable` branch, in addition to all the Citadel team members.
